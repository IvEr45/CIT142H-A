            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Roberto del Rosario (1919â€“2003) was the president of the now-defunct Trebel Music Corporation, 
                a founding member of the Filipino amateur jazz band "The Executives Band Combo," and, in 1975, 
                the inventor of the Karaoke Sing Along System. Known as "Bert," del Rosario patented more than 
                20 inventions during his lifetime, making him one of the most prolific of Filipino inventors.
            </p> 
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Roberto del Rosario was born in Pasay City, Philippines, on June 7, 1919, the son of Teofilo del 
                Rosario and Consolacion Legaspi. During his life, he was never forthright about his age. As a result,
                there are multiple reports on what year he was born, some as late as the mid-1930s. His son Ron 
                del Rosario reported the June 1919 birthdate in a genealogical report.
